    Stuff for points and physics and shit <complete>

GameControl
    Loadable - interface for resources
        Constructor - prepares for loading
        load - loads the resources managed by the object
        unload - unloads the resources managed by the object
        Destructor - ensures unloaded and deletes
    
    Loopable - interface for loopable objects (physics objects which operate over time)
        loop - nothing special
    
    Renderable - interface for renderable objects
        Constructor - prepares for rendering
        depth - has a depth
        render - renders the thing to a thing passed to it or something
        Destructor - unprepare or something
        
    Entity (inherits Loopable and Renderable) - interface for entities which have loop action and can be rendered to the screen
        Constructor - prepares parents
        image - pointer to the image to be rendered
        render - render image
        loop - nothing for a base entity but overloads to do various entity stuff
        Destructor - unprepares parents
    
    DataManager (inherits loadable) - container for mutliple resources in the form of a vector of Loadable pointers
        Constructor - prepares vector
        load - loads all Loadables in vector
        unload - unloads all Loadables in vector
        Destructor - removes vector
    
    LoopEngine (inherits loopable) - container for multiple loopable objects in the form of a vector of Loopable pointers
        Constructor - prepares vector
        loop - calls loop on all Loopable's in vector
        Destructor - unprepares vector
    
    RenderList (inherits renderable) - container for multiple renderable obects in the form of a vector of Renderable pointers
        Constructor - prepares vector
        render - renders objects in vector in order of depth
        Destructor - unprepares vector
    
    EntityGroup (inherits Entity) - container for multiple entities in the form of a vector of Entitie pointers and Loadable pointers and Renderable pointers
        Constructor - prepares vectors
        LoopEngine loopParts - passed same references the main vector is passed
        Renderer renderedParts - passed same references the main vector is passed
        loop - calls loopParts loop
        render - calls renderedParts render
        Destructor - unprepares vectors
    
    GameLoop
        Constructor - prepares for initialization
        init - initializes resources
        reset - should reset the loop to a single state from ANY point in the looping process
        loop - bulk of processing of game. (movement, collisions, scores, all non-rendering continuous processes)
        render - renders
        cleanup - cleans resources, should always return it to the state the constructor leaves it in
        [events] - SDL events which can be overloaded, defaults to do nothing.
        Destructor - ensures cleaned up and prepares object for deletion
